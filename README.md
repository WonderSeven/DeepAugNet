## Automatic Data Augmentation by Learning the Deterministic Policy
---

### Introduction
This is the official implementation of 

[Automatic Data Augmentation by Learning the Deterministic Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08343)

Yinghuan Shi, Tiexin Qin, Yong Liu, Jiwen Lu,  Gao Yang and Dinggang Shen.

The code shall be released once our paper has been accepted. You can download the *demo.mp4* file in this project to see the learned policy by our method in CUB-20.
